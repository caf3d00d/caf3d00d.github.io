# (Dark forest) - what am I even doing?

I'm often asked "what I'm doing". Many have certain misunderstanding and stereotypes that make the simple answer of
"Computer Science" insufficient.

This is an attempt to answer this simple question, in the hopes that I can simple refer people to this article 
instead of explain this for the thousandth time.

## What am I doing?

Simply put "Computer Science". Then what "Computer Science" is? It is all about solving problems.
It then makes a new question (As in ROP-Chain), what is problems? In this context, a problem is a language. You read it right.
A language just like "English", "French" or "Arabic".

### So languages are problems?

A language consists of a set of grammar rules and a set of words that constitute a vocabulary. For example, this article
is a part of the English language because all the sentences conform to the English grammar, and all the words of
the sentences are of the English vocabulary. Though sentences like "He coding", or "He code written" don't conform with
the English grammar, the first one lacks of a verb and the second one is unclear from the word order which noun is the
subject and which is the object.

Turns out that a lot of read-world problems and virtually all computational problems can be represented in terms of languages.
For example, if we want to check if a list of numbers is sorted in order. The problem is same as creating a language in which
the vocabulary is the set of all the numbers, the grammar only allows non-decreasing numbers to appear one after another,
and the problem then becomes testing if the given list is a member of that language?

That being said, "Computer Scientists" work is often concerned with "automatically" and "efficiently" testing if a given
sentence conforms to a given language.
